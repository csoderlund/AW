<h3>Draw</h3>

The colored boxes are the exons. The black are non-coding. The rest of the colors
<br>are only meaningful if there are multiple transcripts, as stacked exons will be
<br>the same color if their coordinates are exactly the same, otherwise the color will be different.
<br>
<br>The variants are the long vertical lines, where red is an indel (not drawn to scale).
<br>The numbers below them correspond to the numbers in the "Vars" and "Pval" popup windows.
<br>A '*' beside a number indicates that there are one or more libraries that are AI for the SNP.
